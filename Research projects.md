**AICRP on Cashew**, ICAR-DCR, Puttur

As a Project Leader, I led and managed research focused on optimizing cashew cultivation practices, crop protection, and varietal improvement. Key achievements include:

**Crop Management:** Implemented organic management practices, optimized high-density planting systems, and explored intercropping in cashew to improve yield while maintaining environmental sustainability.

**Crop Improvement:** Managed germplasm collection and evaluation, developed new hybrid varieties, and conducted multi-location trials to enhance productivity and resilience.

**Pest Management:** Led research on pest control, evaluating insecticides and integrated pest management strategies for cashew, as well as exploring innovative methods to control stem and root borers.

In my role, I led research on horticultural crops in arid zones, focusing on crop yield improvement, resilience, and sustainability under challenging environmental conditions. Key contributions include:

Germplasm Evaluation & Crop Improvement: Led the evaluation of diverse fruit germplasm, focusing on developing high-yielding, climate-resilient varieties of Aonla, Ber, Pomegranate, and Custard Apple.
Innovative Farming Systems: Initiated high-density planting trials in Custard Apple and developed a ber-based cropping system to enhance productivity in arid conditions.
Non-Traditional Crops: Conducted research on the growth and management of non-traditional crops like Jamun, Dragonfruit, and Datepalm, exploring their adaptability to arid environments.
