      <h2>Vimala Bathineni</h2>
    </div>
    <p> With over seven years in horticultural research, I am passionate about advancing agricultural practices and supporting farming communities. As a Project Leader at the Cashew Research Station, Bapatla, I released BPP-10 and BPP-11 cashew varieties, identified the promising H-218 hybrid.</p>
    <p> At the Horticulture Research Station, Anantapur, I improved germplasm for Aonla, Ber, Pomegranate, and Tamarind, introduced high-density planting techniques, and identified new tamarind lines (PU-11, PU-13, PU-15)and popularized Thettu Amalika and Anantha Rudhira tamarind varieties. I also enhanced crop diversity with Jamun, Date Palm, and Dragonfruit, and conducted multi-location trials for pomegranate.</p>
    <p>After relocating to Denmark, I expanded my expertise by learning artificial intelligence, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks. I am excited to integrate this knowledge with my horticultural background to create innovative approaches that support and benefit farmers.</p>
