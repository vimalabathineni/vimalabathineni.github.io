    <p> From September 2016 to August 2023, I worked as an Assistant Professor/Scientist at the Horticulture Research Station in Anantapuramu, under Dr. Y.S.R. Horticultural University.</p>
    <p> My work focused on research in production management, pest and disease control, training and pruning techniques, developing and identifying new varieties, commercializing released varieties, and nursery management—bridging the gap between scientific research and practical solutions for farmers.</p>
    <p>After relocating to Denmark, I expanded my expertise by learning artificial intelligence, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks. I am excited to integrate this knowledge with my horticultural background to create innovative approaches that support and benefit farmers.</p>
