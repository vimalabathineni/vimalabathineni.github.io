Currently, I am working on the following topics and their applications in healthcare, IIoT, and Fusion energy. These can be categorized into four main areas:

### 1. **Responsible AI**
- **Personalized Federated Learning**: Tailoring AI models to individual (or subgroups of the population) needs while maintaining data privacy.
- **Security and Privacy in Federated Learning**: Enhancing the safety and confidentiality of distributed learning systems.
- **Machine Unlearning**: Removing/erasing the knowledge of specific data samples from already trained AI models to comply with data regulations.
- **Fairness-Aware AI**: Promoting unbiased and equitable decision-making in AI systems.

### 2. **Advanced Learning Techniques**
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Leveraging abundant unlabeled data in the presence of very limited labeled data.
- **Continual Learning**: Enabling AI models to adapt and learn continuously from new data.
- **Meta Learning**: Developing AI models that can adapt swiftly to new tasks.

### 3. **AI in Healthcare and Industrial Applications**
- **AI for Healthcare**: Applying advanced AI techniques to improve outcomes in healthcare, including diagnostics and personalized treatment.
- **AI for IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)**: Enhancing automation and decision-making in industrial settings through AI models that process large-scale sensor data.

### 4. **Physics-Informed AI and Advanced Models**
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**: Integrating physical laws into neural networks for more accurate predictions in complex systems like energy or medical simulations.
- **AI for Fusion Energy**: Leveraging AI models, particularly, PINNs to forecast fuel-ion ratio.
