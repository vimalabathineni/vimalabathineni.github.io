    <p>I am an Assistant Professor at the Applied Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Unit, The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, University of Southern Denmark (since July 2023).</p>
    <p>My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Deep Learning, Federated Learning (also known as Decentralized Machine Learning), Graph Machine Learning, and Machine Unlearning. I apply these technologies in Healthcare, the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and Fusion Energy. My work aims to develop novel AI algorithms that enhance performance, protect privacy, and promote fairness by mitigating bias.</p>
    <p>Aside from the fundamental research in AI, I have also been developing AI-driven early detection systems for Colorectal Cancer, Cardio Calcification, Cervical Cancer, and Dementia, striving to improve patient management through advanced diagnostic tools.</p>
