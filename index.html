   <p> I am an Assistant Professor at the Applied Artifical Intelligence and Data Science Unit, The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute University of Southern Denmark (since July 2023).
   <p> My research spans Deep Learning, Federated Learning (also referred to as Decentralized Machine Learning), Graph Machine Learning and Machine Learning with applications in the Healthcare, Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and Fusion Energy. I have advanced Federated Learning by addressing communication load, privacy, security, and personalization. I have developed a personalized cervical cancer screening recommender system to address under- and over-treatment and have been working on AI-driven early detection systems for colorectal cancer, cardio calcification, and dementia. My work in Machine Unlearning guides AI to comply with data regulations like GDPR and the AI Act, thereby protecting individual privacy while promoting unbiased decision-making. I am an IEEE Senior Member and recipient of the HC Ørsted Research Talent Award, 2024.
