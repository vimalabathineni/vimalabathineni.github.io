As a Project Leader, I led and executed critical research projects aimed at improving cashew cultivation practices, crop protection, and varietal development. My work primarily focused on enhancing productivity, sustainability, and pest management.

**Crop Management & Innovation:**
Implemented organic management techniques, optimized fertilizer use in high-density cashew plantations, and explored intercropping systems.
Led successful trials on high-density planting, aiming to increase production while maintaining soil health.

**Research on Crop Improvement:**
Managed germplasm collection, evaluation, and cataloguing, contributing significantly to the genetic diversity of cashew varieties.
Conducted multi-location trials and hybridization programs, enhancing productivity and resilience in cashew crops.

**Pest Management & Protection:**(Project Associate)
Pioneered insecticide efficacy trials and developed integrated pest management solutions for cashew.
Led research on the control of cashew stem and root borers, using innovative curative treatments post-extraction.

In my leadership role, I directed projects focused on horticultural crops in arid zones, including Aonla, Ber, Pomegranate, and Custard Apple. My work aimed at improving crop yield, resilience, and sustainable agricultural practices in challenging climates.

**Germplasm Evaluation & Varietal Development:**
Led the evaluation and maintenance of diverse germplasm collections for multiple fruits, supporting the development of high-yielding, resilient cultivars.
Spearheaded varietal trials and pruning standardization, optimizing crop performance for various fruits, including Pomegranate and Custard Apple.

**High-Density Planting & Crop Systems:**
Introduced and managed high-density planting trials, especially for Custard Apple, maximizing yield and optimizing space usage.
Developed a ber-based cropping system, improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability in the region.

**Non-Plan Horticulture Projects & Innovation:**
Conducted research on Jamun, Dragonfruit, Datepalm, and other nontraditional crops, focusing on growth patterns, propagation techniques, and crop management under arid conditions.
